# transformers
Tutorial repository to understand transformer model architecture.

The code has been written as a follow along to Aladdin Persson's (@aladdinpersson) 
great [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0s0f995w14&t=1939s).

As a result, most of the code has been taken from this
[repo](https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/blob/master/ML/Pytorch/more_advanced/transformer_from_scratch/transformer_from_scratch.py)

The code has been made more modular and has additional comments and docstrings to aid in understanding the 
Transformer architecture.
